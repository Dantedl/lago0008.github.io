        <p>I'm a current student from the School of Media & Design from Algonquin College.<br> 
            I enlisted in the Interactive Media & Design program in 2018, following my passion<br> 
            for the use of technologies and photography. Then, I fell in love with the coding skills <br>
            shown by the school. </p>
        <p>As a student, I define myself as a cheerful student, full of energy who is always looking to <br> 
            improve his work. As a novice, I have demonstrated how fast I can master essentials and use <br>
             them on the go when it comes to present any type of work to my peers and professors.</p>
